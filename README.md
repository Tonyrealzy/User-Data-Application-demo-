## Code Structure

The project follows a component-based approach, leveraging the powerful concepts of TypeScript and the Angular framework. The codebase is organized into different files and folders, ensuring a modular and maintainable structure. This separation of concerns allows for easy navigation and understanding of the application's functionality.
